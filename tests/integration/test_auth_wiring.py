"""Auth wiring integration tests (Task 14, brief §14.4).

Verifies the contract from mcp-common-auth-primitives plan §14:

1. Unauthenticated tool call → 401 / ``AuthenticationRequiredError`` (or
   any rejection that mentions the auth surface).
2. Authenticated tool call with a valid Bearer token → reaches the tool
   body (here, exercised via ``seed_principal`` + ``@require_auth``).
3. ``/health`` envelope includes the ``auth`` component.
4. Bonus: JWT provider configured without ``auth.secret`` surfaces a
   clear ``RuntimeError`` at startup (I-9 fix).

These tests construct ``Runtime`` directly via ``build_runtime`` rather
than going through the FastMCP HTTP transport — FastMCP's test client
adds layer-of-indirection we don't need here, and the brief's smoke
assertions are about wiring shape, not transport semantics.
